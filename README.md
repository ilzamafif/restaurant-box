## Tools Stack
- **Module Bundler**: I use webpack 4 for bundling a module. I used some extra loader and plugin to supports Progressive Web Apps.
- **UI Components**: I like Web Component, especially because it is a native API. So I decided to include `LitElement`.
- **Linting**: My code style based on AirBnB style. I use ESLint for linting.

## How to Use
To use this starter pack is quite easy. Download or Clone this repository. Then run the command `npm run install`. Start coding!

## How to Run
- `npm run start-dev` for running a project in development mode.
- `npm run start-dev-sw` same as above, but with Service Worker (work offline capability).
- `npm run build-local` building a project in production mode with BundleWebpackAnalyzer.
- `npm run build` build a project in production mode with test validation.
- `npm run test` running test.
